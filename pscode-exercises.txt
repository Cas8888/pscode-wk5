// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a value
divide inputted value by 2
if resulting value is a whole number, print 'even'
if resulting value is a decimal, print 'odd'


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

-- END --

ask for 5 different values (a, b, c, d, e)

a + b + c + d + e= sum
add values together
divide sum by 5

identify largest number
identify smallest numbers

print "average:" and result
print "minimum:" and smallest value
print "maximum:" and largest value
